# Incident Response Management

This repository holds the code, binary files and card templates for the **Incident Management & Response** project run by the [University of the West of England (UWE)](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/). 

The project itself aims to educate players on the complexities of incident management. Students work through a turn based card game trying to gain capital and repuation while managing incidents. There are 3 main card types:

### Incident 

A cyber security related attack or event, such as a network scan

### Asset

A tool or security measure which helps mitigate incidents

### Business Opportunity 

A chance for players to earn more capital or reputation

Capital and reputation are the scoring system used in the game. Players pay capital to purchase assets. These can then allow them to have business opportunities. Reputation and capital are gained through business opportunities and lost through incidents. Incidents, if unmitigated, can also cause players to lose existing Business Opportunities. 

Both the card templates and browser based versions of this game are avaliable in this repo
